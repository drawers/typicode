Using the endpoints available at <https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/>, 
display a list of posts along with the comments associated with each post. 

Feel free to use Kotlin or Java as well as any other libraries of your choice. 

We don’t expect you to spend too long on this and aren’t expecting production ready code. 

What we are looking to understand is how you break down a problem, your thought process 
and how you structure your code amongst other things. 

If you would like to proceed, please complete the following technical test 
and share the link with us by Friday, 1st May, 2020. 

Once we receive the link to the completed test, we will be in touch about the next steps.
